- **Most Popular Subscription Types**: Identified the most frequently selected subscription types, showing customer preferences.
- **Average Subscription Duration**: Calculated average subscription duration across all customers, revealing how long customers typically remain subscribed.
- **Subscription Patterns by Region**: Created reports summarizing subscriptions by region, helping to pinpoint regions with the highest engagement.

### Data Querying 
Using SQL, I performed deeper querying to uncover specific customer trends and regional insights. Key findings included:
- **Total Customers by Region**: Showed customer distribution across regions, identifying the top regions by number of customers.
- **Top Subscription Types by Popularity**: Identified the most popular subscription types based on customer count, adding precision to Excelâ€™s findings.
- **Subscription Cancellations**: Highlighted customers who canceled within six months, providing insights into early-stage churn.
- **Revenue Insights**: Calculated total revenue by subscription type and discovered top revenue-generating segments.

### Data Visualization
In Power BI, I developed a dynamic, interactive dashboard that visually communicates these insights, allowing for easy exploration. Key findings included:
- **Sales Overview**: A high-level view of total subscriptions, cancellations, and revenue, showing overall performance trends.
- **Customer Segmentation**: An analysis of customer behavior across segments, including active and canceled subscriptions.
- **Regional Trends and Cancellations**: Breakdown of regions with high cancellation rates, displayed with interactive visuals to emphasize trends.
- **Time-Based Insights**: Monthly sales and cancellation trends were visualized to show seasonality in customer behavior.

## Recommendations
------------
1. **Target High-Cancellation Regions**: Focus retention efforts on regions with high cancellation rates to improve customer retention.
2. **Promote Popular Subscription Types**: Invest in marketing the most popular subscription types to attract new customers.
3. **Analyze Short-Term Cancellations**: Examine factors influencing cancellations within the first six months to identify improvement opportunities in early customer engagement.
